DATA is stored in just key and values.

NOSQL stores data in collections and inside collections is a document.

documents stores data in rows and columns in the format of key- value pairs.

collections are similar to a table inside of a database. They are a group of documents.
document is the data stored inside of a collection/table in the format of key-value pairs.

Each object has its own object id.
